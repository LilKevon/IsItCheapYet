# IsItCheapYet, Time Purchases, Save Money ðŸ’°

I had a issue with Old Navy growing up. No matter how where I looked, I always saw a "sale!" on items I wanted, but still felt too expensive. Even after waiting months, the same items were still on sale, and it got me thinking.

Are these sales even worth it?

So, I decided to take this matter into my own hands, and create a project that would allow me to peer into Old Navy's sale trends. Maybe then I would be able to get some good deals!

Introducing, IsItCheapYet, a full stack web app that allows users to see and visualize price trends on some of Old Navy's on sale items. While still in Alpha(Only able to see one item's price and track the trend), new releases will come out soon with more features that
will help anyone save money by timing their purchases.
